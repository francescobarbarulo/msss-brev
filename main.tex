\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Mobility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physical}: hardware actually changes its physical position;
    \item \textbf{Logical}: applications and data may need to be moved for design reasons.
\end{itemize}

Mobile computing relys on the ability to use devices \textit{non-physically connected} and \textit{context-aware}. And these devices must keep computinal and communicaiton capabilities paying attention to energy comsumption because of their battery-powered nature.

\section{Localization systems}
Localization systems consist of two main blocks:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
	\item Set of deployed nodes with different \textit{states}:
		\begin{itemize}
		 	\item \textbf{beacon} (\textit{landmarks} or \textit{anchors}): already know their locations through a manual configuration or through GPS reading;
		  	\item \textbf{unknown} (\textit{targets}): do not have any information about their geographic locations;
		  	\item \textbf{settled}: targets nodes that has determined or estimated their locations.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Localization algorithm:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item GPS not longer used in CPS for cost and energy constraints;
			\item \textbf{GPS-free} techniques exploit the sensing and the wireless communication capabilities of CPS components.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Topology}
The topology of a localization algorithm refers to \textit{where} and \textit{how} the location of a given node is calculated:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Centralized localizaiton}: a central device estimates the location of unknown nodes based on the signal measurements forwarded by anchors;
	\item \textbf{Localized localization}: each object estimates its location using the collected signal measurements and location information of the anchor nodes in its neighbourhood.
\end{itemize}

We can distinguish four different system topologies for localization systems, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:topology}.

\subsection{Coordinate System}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Physical}: locations are represented as a point in a 2D/3D coordinate system;
  \item \textbf{Symbolic}: locations are expressed as logical positionsâ€™ information;
  \item \textbf{Absolute}: locations are expressed as unique coordinate values making reference to \textit{anchor} nodes that know their positions;
  \item \textbf{Relative}: locations are determined relatively to other nodes with no reference to absolute anchors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication paradigm}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Non-cooperative}: the communication is restricted between unknown nodes and anchors (\textit{high density} of anchors or \textit{long-range anchor transmissions} are needed);
  \item \textbf{Cooperative}: allows communication between unknown nodes (more \textit{processing} is required);
  \item \textbf{Opportunistic}: exploits interactions between nodes that occasionally pass each other in their proximity (efficient \textit{node discovery} and \textit{data exchange}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance metrics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Accuracy}: mean (Euclidean) distance error between the estimated location and the true location;
  \item \textbf{Precision}: variation over many algorithm trials, CDF of distance error;
  \item \textbf{Complexity}: hardware and/or software;
  \item \textbf{Robustness}: behavior under unwanted conditions;
  \item \textbf{Scalability}: geographical and density;
  \item \textbf{Cost}
\end{itemize}
